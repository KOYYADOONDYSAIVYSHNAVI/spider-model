## Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

## Clone the Repository
### First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
git clone <repository-url>

```
### Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository.

## Open the Project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and open it in VS Code. You can do this directly from the terminal:

```
cd <project-directory>
code .
```
### Replace <project-directory> with the name of your project directory.

### To start the application for the homepage, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. The application will then be available at http://localhost:3000/.

### If encountered any errors during running, try deleting the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` and navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` and then re-run `npm start`.
